4 Direction Animated Warrior by Calciumtrice
--------------------------------------------

An animated warrior character with 4 unique directions.

With the exception of the death animation, every animation comes in unique left, right, front and back facing versions, with and without a sword.

The animations included are:

- Idle
- Movement
- Attack
- Death

Handy tips:

- The unarmed attack animation has an extra frame (frame 3) that can be used for a dash by alternating the 2nd and 3rd frames for the duration of the dash. You may want to leave out the 3rd frame when using it as a regular punch.

- The unarmed attack animation might also be used as a throw/interaction animation by dropping the first (wind-up) and third (extra) frames.

- The death animation can be used as a 'knocked out' animation by slowly alternating the two final frames after playing the rest of the animation (to work as wriggling/breathing on the ground) - take a non-lethal approach!
